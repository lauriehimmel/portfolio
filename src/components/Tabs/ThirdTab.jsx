          I'm currently taking the very first project, built with JavaScript, and turning it into a React app. I'm looking forward to seeing the growth I've made, and being able to execute on this project exactly the way I had originally envisioned.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p><strong>Mastermind</strong> is usually a two-player game, but I wanted to create a version where the user plays against the computer to guess its randomly-generated code.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Stay tuned for the finished product!</p>
